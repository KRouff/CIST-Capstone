# CIST-Capstone
My capstone project for my major
Created a website using PHP, HTML, and MySQL on an Amazon ec2 linux server with a connected MySQL database with Amazon RDS.
Project was to make a entertainment tracking website so people could keep track and rate all kinds of entertainment one may consume in their lifetime.
Project was finished in time and by the end had nearly 200,000 data entris. Entries were collected manually or through a web scraper.
